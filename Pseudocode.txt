Exercise 27 - Pseudocode

Write a Pseudocode for the programs you created for the exercises 25, 24 and 23
* Exercise 23 – for your for loop that calculates the sum
* Exercise 24 – for your while loop that searches for a specific number
* Exercise 25 – for your loops that find the maximal value of a matrix

Exercise 23 - Your first loops
sum = 0
for range():
    add i to sum

Exercise 24 - 3 while loops
while i < list:
    if list[i] = searched_number:
        print found
    i+1

Exercise 25 - Loop trough a matrix
max = 0
for i in outer_matrix:
    for j in inner_matrix:
        if matrix[i,j] > max:
          max = matrix[i,j]
print max
