## Exercise 27 - Pseudocode

Write a Pseudocode for the programs you created for the exercises 25, 24 and 23
* Exercise 23 – for your for loop that calculates the sum
* Exercise 24 – for your while loop that searches for a specific number
* Exercise 25 – for your loops that find the maximal value of a matrix

**Exercise 23 - Your first loops** [(`FirstLoop.py`)](https://github.com/rominafernandez/Python_Loops/blob/master/FirstLoop.py)
sum = 0
for range():
    add i to sum

**Exercise 24 - 3 while loops** [(`WhileLoops.py`)](https://github.com/rominafernandez/Python_Loops/blob/master/WhileLoops.py)
while i < list:
    if list[i] = searched_number:
        print found
    i+1

**Exercise 25 - Loop trough a matrix** [(`MatrixLoop.py`)](https://github.com/rominafernandez/Python_Loops/blob/master/MatrixLoop.py)
max = 0
for i in outer_matrix:
    for j in inner_matrix:
        if matrix[i,j] > max:
            max = matrix[i,j]
print max
